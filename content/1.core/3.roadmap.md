# Roadmap

**Phase 1: Neural Base and Data Collection (In Progress)**

- **Objective**: Create a rudimentary neural simulation of the tardigrade using extant biological research.
- Collaborate with Researchers to collect and process neural data.
- Develop a basic neural network for imitating simple behaviors exhibited by tardigrades, including movement and survival states.

**Stage 2: Tardi Terminal**

- **Objective:** Build an interactive app for tracking and engaging with Tardi’s behavior.
- Searchable Transactions: Allow users to view how their $TARDI transactions affect Tardi's movements and state.
- Have Tardi tweet independently about its movements, state changes, and significant interactions.

**Phase 3: On-Chain Integration**

- **Objective:** Deploy the neural simulation of the tardigrade to the blockchain.
- Update the neural simulation to be modular and on-chain.
- Explain how each type of transaction translates to "energy" for the tardigrade.

**Phase 4: Neurobiological and Behavioral Simulation**

- **Objective**: Develop detailed neural and behavioral models based on state-of-the-art biological research. 
- Mapping the Neural Connectome: Use electron microscopy to map the neural network of the tardigrade, integrating the findings into the simulation. 
- Behavioral Studies: Simulate the basic tardigrade behaviors—moving, feeding, and survival states—validated through real-world observations. 
- Genome Annotation: Construct the whole metabolic and functional pathways from the available genomic data.

**Phase 5: Coming Soon**
